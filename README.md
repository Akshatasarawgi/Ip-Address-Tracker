# IP address tracker solution

This is a solution to the [IP address tracker challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

The project was made with the help of [IP Geolocation API by Ipify](https://geo.ipify.org/) to get the IP address and [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) to generate the map.

### The challenge
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location
